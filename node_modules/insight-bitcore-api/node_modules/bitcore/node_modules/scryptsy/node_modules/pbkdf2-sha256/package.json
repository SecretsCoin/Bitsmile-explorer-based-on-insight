  "readme": "pbkdf2-sha256\n=============\n\n`pbkdf2-sha256` is a JavaScript implementation of [PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) using the SHA256 HMAC. It's fully compatible with Node.js and the browser (via Browserify).\n\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nThis is useful for the [Scrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) algorithm.\n\nWhy not just use the Node.js `pbkdf2` function? The Node.js `pbkdf2` function uses the `sha1` algorithm and not the `sha256` algorithm for its pseudorandom function. This will change when Node v0.12 is released. Until then, this is the next best option.\n\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n### Installation\n\n    npm install --save pbkdf2-sha256\n\n### Example\n\n```js\nvar pbkdf2 = require('pbkdf2-sha256');\n\nvar key = 'passwd';\nvar salt = new Buffer('salt');\nvar res = pbkdf2(key, salt, 1, 64);\nconsole.log(res.toString('hex')) // => 55ac046e56e3089fec1691c22544b605f94185216dde0465e68b9d57c20dacbc49ca9cccf179b645991664b39d77ef317c71b845b1e30bd509112041d3a19783\n```\n\n### Bundling for the Browser\n\nTo use in the browser, clone the repo and then download [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify):\n\n    npm install -g browserify\n\nrun:\n\n    browserify --standalone pbdkf2 < lib/pbkdf2.js > pbdkf2.bundle.js\n\nthen include `pbdkf2.bundle.js` in your `<script>` tag in your html. \n\n\n### Testing\n\nIf you want to test the algorithm, clone the git repo. Then run `npm install --development` to install all of the dependencies.\n\n#### Node.js\n\nrun:\n\n    make test-node\n\n### Browser\n\nrun:\n\n    make test-browser\n\nafter you're finished, you can kill the test browser server (test-browser.js) by running:\n\n    make kill\n\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n### Alternative Implementations\n\n- https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/blob/master/core/pbkdf2.js (Stanford JavaScript Crypto Library)\n- https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/source/browse/tags/3.1.2/src/pbkdf2.js (CryptoJS)\n\nWhy didn't I use either one of these? They're not Node.js optimized. They also don't use native types, so they'll be slower in the browser.\n\n\n### Credits\n\nBased upon the following code https://github.com/cheongwy/node-scrypt-js/blob/master/lib/pbkdf2.js which is based upon https://github.com/wg/scrypt/blob/master/src/main/java/com/lambdaworks/crypto/PBKDF.java\n\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2014, JP Richardson\nCopyright (c) 2010-2011 Intalio Pte, All Rights Reserved\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
