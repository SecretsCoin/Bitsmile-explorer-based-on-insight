It's a part of the [BIP38](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) standard for encrypting private Bitcoin keys. It also serves as the [proof-of-work system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) for many crypto currencies, most notably: Litecoin and Dogecoin.\n\nWhy didn't I just the predominant pure JavaScript imlementation found [here](https://github.com/cheongwy/node-scrypt-js)? Because it's riddled with bugs, contains no tests, and is a transliteration of the Java version. i.e. it's neither Node.js optimized nor browser optimized. Required optimizations: [Buffer](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) in Node.js and [type arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) in the browser.\n\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n### Installation\n\n    npm install --save scryptsy\n\n\n### Example\n\n```js\nvar scrypt = require('scryptsy').scrypt;\n\nvar key = \"pleaseletmein\";\nvar salt = \"SodiumChloride\";\nvar data = scrypt(key, salt, 16384, 8, 1, 64);\nconsole.log(data.toString('hex')) \n// => 7023bdcb3afd7348461c06cd81fd38ebfda8fbba904f8e3ea9b543f6545da1f2d5432955613f0fcf62d49705242a9af9e61e85dc0d651e40dfcf017b45575887\n```\n\n### Bundling for the Browser\n\nTo use in the browser, clone the repo and then download [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify):\n\n    npm install -g browserify\n\nrun:\n\n    browserify --standalone pbdkf2 < lib/pbkdf2.js > pbdkf2.bundle.js\n\nthen include `pbdkf2.bundle.js` in your `<script>` tag in your html. \n\n\n### Testing\n\nIf you want to test the algorithm, clone the git repo. Then run `npm install --development` to install all of the dependencies.\n\n#### Node.js\n\nrun:\n\n    make test-node\n\n### Browser\n\nrun:\n\n    make test-browser\n\n\nResources\n---------\n- [Tarsnap Blurb on Scrypt][tarsnap]\n- [node-scrypt](https://github.com/barrysteyn/node-scrypt) A Node.js wrapper for the C++ scrypt utility\n- [Scrypt Whitepaper](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf)\n- [IETF Scrypt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-josefsson-scrypt-kdf-00) (Test vector params are [incorrect](https://twitter.com/dchest/status/247734446881640448).)\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThis code was modified from the code found here https://github.com/cheongwy/node-scrypt-js which was based on https://github.com/wg/scrypt.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2014, JP Richardson Copyright (c) 2010-2011 Intalio Pte, All Rights Reserved\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
